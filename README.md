## What dis?

This repo contains `svg` and `icns` icon files for a few apps. These icons are destined to replace the older ones to fit macOS Big Sur style.

Also contains icons for folders, use them to keep your stuff organized ðŸ˜‰.

`index.js` builds the `icns` files from the `png` ones. Maybe next commit I will add code to convert directly from `svg`...
